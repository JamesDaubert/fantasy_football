Maybe this will help me win my league...

Input: Google Sheets of teams
Output: Google sheet of predicted outcome based off of multiple sims, i.e. the ranking of each team

Todo:

Pull all teams, get point projections for the players/season total for the teams
Generate schedule, randomize points in each matchup
Create bracket based off of outcome of 15 weeks

throw exceptions if team names don't match?

could have automated:
* roster generation in google docs probably, but i wanted my league's teams
